I created this project as a template to quickly create .Net Core web apps that require Authentication and Authorization. 

My initial push was a minimal shell of a working app. From here I will create some styling using bootstrap and icons from icons8.com and publish app for live viewing.

Steps taken in order to generate app.
1.) Create new .NetCore web app with Authenticat Type set to Individual Accounts.
2.) Create Google Cloud App https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/social/google-logins?view=aspnetcore-6.0
3.) Add authentication and authorization to start up configure and configureServices
4.) Save Secrets from Google Cloud App for ClientID and ClientSecret
5.) Run app and register a new local account in order to run first migration.
